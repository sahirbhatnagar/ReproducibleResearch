%\item Used for producing scientific and mathematical documents
\item Input for \LaTeX \, is composed in plain \texttt{ASCII} using a text editor
%\item Unike Word, \LaTeX\, \textbf{\textit{is not}} What you see is what you get (WYSIWYG)
\item Although Word is useful for writing very short and simple documents, it becomes too complex or even unusable for more complicated tasks
\item Commonly needed features, like user-customized automated numbering or various automated indexes, cannot be created using Word at all
\item \LaTeX \,does require more effort and time to learn to use even for simpler tasks, but once learned, difficult tasks can be accomplished rather easily and straightforwardly
